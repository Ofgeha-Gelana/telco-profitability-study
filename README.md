# Telecom User Behavior and Satisfaction Analysis

This project aims to analyze user behavior and satisfaction within the telecommunication sector using comprehensive data insights.

---

## ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**
The primary objective of this project is to explore and understand telecom user behavior, engagement patterns, and satisfaction levels by leveraging user data, network metrics, and advanced analytical methods.

---

## ðŸ“‚ **Dataset**
The project uses a telecom dataset that includes:
- **User Information**: Details about users and their demographics.
- **Usage Data**: Insights into user activity and engagement levels.
- **Network Metrics**: Key parameters like TCP retransmission rates, round-trip time (RTT), and throughput.

---

## ðŸš€ **Key Functionalities**
The project is designed to perform the following analytical tasks:

1. **User Overview Analysis**
   - Identifies the most popular handsets and manufacturers.
   - Examines user behavior patterns to derive actionable insights.

2. **User Engagement Analysis**
   - Computes engagement metrics such as session frequency, duration, and traffic usage.
   - Segments users into groups using K-Means clustering for targeted analysis.

3. **Experience Analysis**
   - Evaluates network performance through metrics like TCP retransmissions, RTT, and throughput.
   - Analyzes how handset characteristics impact user experience.

4. **Satisfaction Analysis**
   - Calculates satisfaction scores by integrating engagement and experience metrics.
   - Develops a regression model to predict user satisfaction levels based on collected data.
